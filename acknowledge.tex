I would like to thank my thesis advisor, Jennifer Martin, for her constant encouragement and honest feedback throughout the writing process. I would also like to thank my friend, Dennis Monokroussos, who has been a tremendous help throughout the process. In particular, he directed my attention to Eleonore Stump, whose work is featured prominently in this thesis. He also gave great encouragement and clear and honest feedback.\\

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my mother for everything she has done for me throughout my life and for her sacrifice in securing my education. She has been a source of constant love, support and inspiration. My father, who passed away in 2007, has also been a great inspiration to me and this project in particular. \\
