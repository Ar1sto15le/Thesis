Aristotle Metaphysics Outline

I:1-2
All men desire to know --- we love our senses, especially sight, because it ``makes us know and brings to light many differences between things.''

 ``from sensation memory is produced'' --- ``the animals other than man live by appearances and memories, and have but little of connected experience; but the human race lives also by art and reasonings... from MEMORY experience is produced in men; for the several memories of the same thing produce finally the capacity for a single experience.'' .... we think that experience is like an art or a science, ``but really science and art come to men \emph{through} experience.... art arises when from many notions gained by experience one universal judgement about a calss of jobjects is produced.''

men of experience vs men of art --- easily confused when it comes to action --- ``the reason is that experience is knowledge of individuals, art of universals, and actions and productions are concerned with the individual.''

knowledge and understanding seem to belong to art rather than experience.... ``again, we do not regard any of the senses as WISDOM; yet surely these give the most authoritative knowledge of partiuculars. But they do not tell us the `why' of anything... why fire is hot; they only say that it is is hot.''

Purpose in Writing: ``but the point of our present discussion is this, that all men suppose what is called Wisdom to deal with the first causes and the principles of things''

I:2
assumption: that he who is more exact and more capable of teaching the causes is wiser, in every branch of knowldge;

And understanding and knowledge pursued for their own sake are found most in the knowledge of that which is most knowable... what is most knowable is what is truly knowledge....

Historically, this sort of science was not practised until man was comfortable enough to have leisure.... mathematics first practiced in egpty, for example... ``evidently then we do not seek it for the sake of an other advantage; but as the man is free, we say, who exists for his own sake and not for another's, so we pursue this as the only free science, for it alone exists for its own sake.'' (i.e. --- he is describing the nature of Wisdom, the nature of what kind of knowledge it is... what its principles are, etc...)

It is divine and the possession of it might be justly regarded as beyond human power... it is divine in two ways... it has God and the divine as its object; and it is only suitable for God to have this knowledge. ``all the sciences are more necessary than this, but none is better.''

II:1
Investigation of truth is hard because of a defect in us: ``For as the eyes of bats are to the blaze of day, so is the reson in our soul to the things which are by nature most evident of all.''

philosophy --> knowledge of truth ``for the end of theoretical knowledge is truth, while that of practical knowledge is action''

WHy must eteranl things be true: ``hence the principles of eternal things must be always most true (for they are not merely sometimes true, nor is there any cause of their being, but they themselves are the cause of the being of other things....''

IV: 1-3
``There is a sciene which investigates being as being and attributes which belong to this in virtue of its own nature (metaphysics)... this is different from special sciences, such as mathematics, which only investigate a small part of being....

There are many senses in which a thing may be said to be but alll that `is' is related to one central point, one definite kind of thing, and is not said to `be' by a mere ambiguity...

but everywhere science deals chiefly with that which is primary, and on which the other things depend, and in virtue of which they get their names. If, then, this is substance, it wil be of substances that the philosopher must grasp the principles and that causes...

For some will be called what they are called because they posses it, others because they produce it, and others in other such ways.. it is evident then that it belongs to one science to be able to give an account of these concepts as well as of substance...

funny: for if it is not the function of the philosopher, who is it who will inquire wehter Socrates and Socrates seated are the same thing, or whether one thing has one contrary, or what contrariety is?

For number qua number has peculiar attributes, such as oddness and evenness, commensurability and equality, excess and defect, and these belong to numbers either in themselves or in relation to on another... 

we must state wehter it belongs to one or to different sciences to inquire into the truths which are in mathematics called axioms and into substance. evidently then it belongs to the philosopher, to him who is studying the nature of all substance, to inquire also into the principles of syllogism...

For it is impossible for any one to believe the same thing to be and not to be, as some thin Heraclitus says.... 

III: 5
for many men hold beliefs in which they conflict with one antoher, and think those mistaken who have not the same opinions as themselves; so that the same thing must both be andnot be. and on the other hand, if this is so, allopinions, umst be true; for thsoe who are mistaken and those who are right are opposed to one another in their opinions; if, then, reality is suhch as the view in quiestion supposes, all will be right in their beliefs.

They think that contradictories or contraries are ture at the same time, because they see contraries coming into existence out of the samet hing.

they speak rightly and in a sense they err ... for `that which is' has two meanings, so that in some sense a thing can come to be out of that which is not, while in some sense it cannot, and the same thing can at the same time be in being and not in being --- but not in the same respect. For the same thing can be potentially at the same time two contraries, but it cannot actually... a bananna is potentially ripe and rotten, but it cannot be ripe and rotten actually.... for example...

the erason that these thinkers eror is because they suppose knowledge to be sensation.. so that what apepars to our suenses must be true.. ... but the erason why these thinkers held this opinion is that while they were inquiring into the truth of that which is, they thought `that which is' iwas identical witht he sensisble world... ni this, however, there is largely present the nature of the indeterminate---of that which exists in the pecular sense which we have explained... 

we must show them and persuade them that there is something whose nature is changeless... regarding the nature of truth, we must maintain that not everything which appears is true....

in generail, if only the sensible exists, there would be nothing if animate things were not; for there would be no faculty of sense... for sensation is surely not the sensation of itself, but there is something beyond the sensation , which must be prior to the sensation... 


VI:1
There must , then, be three theoretical philosophies, mathematics, physics and what we may call theology, since it is obvious that if the divine is present anywhere, it is present in things of this sort. and the highest science must deal wti the highest genus.
